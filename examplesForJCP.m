%  Usage: Run the entire script to generate the examples for the JCP paper 
%         [1]. For the pendulum example (ex. 26), Matlab needs to be able 
%         to call Python to generate the phase portraits. For the 2D 
%         Allen-Cahn example, you will need to install the M-M.E.S.S. 
%         package to access the LR-ADI solver. We also suggest to install
%         the tensor_recursive package for the more efficient tensor
%         Lyapunov solver, or you can use the built-in Bartels-Stewart
%         solver. 
% 
%  Description: The examples used in the paper [1] are:
%
%       Example 10: 1D ODE toy example with transcritical bifurcation. The
%       code here prints out the values printed in the paper in Section
%       5.1, namely the open- and closed-loop dynamics for the LQR and PPR
%       controllers. The phase portraits in Fig. 2 in the paper are plotted 
%       using tikz and pgfplots.
%
%       Example 26: Nondimensionalized 2D inverted pendulum. The code here
%       plots the phase portraits, value function contour plots, and HJB
%       residuals for Figs. 3 & 4. A separate function computes the 
%       integrated costs for Table 1.
%
%       Example 9: Chebychev discretization of Allen-Cahn equation with
%       Neumann boundary conditions. The code here compares LQR, SDRE, PPR,
%       and TT-HJB, generating a cost convergence plot Fig. 6 to show if 
%       the controllers are successfully stabilizing the origin, table of controller costs 
%       Table 2, and closed-loop simulation surface plots Fig. 7. 
%
%       Example 29: Finite element discretization of Allen-Cahn equation 
%       with Neumann boundary conditions. The code computes a reduced-PPR
%       controller and simulates the closed-loop system to demonstrate the
%       scalability of the approach, generating the plots for Fig. 9.
